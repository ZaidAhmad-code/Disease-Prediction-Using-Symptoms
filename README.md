# 🧠 Disease Prediction Web App

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts diseases based on user-input symptoms. The system uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on a medical dataset and is deployed using **Flask**.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to assist users in getting a probable diagnosis by selecting or typing symptoms into a simple and user-friendly web interface.

### ✅ Key Highlights

- Built with **Python**, **Flask**, and **Scikit-learn**
- **Random Forest model** used for disease prediction
- **Autocomplete symptom input** using JavaScript for improved user experience
- Real-time disease prediction based on selected symptoms
- Uses **joblib** to load the pre-trained model and encoders

## 🎯 Goal

To demonstrate how machine learning can be integrated into web applications for healthcare-related use cases — making early symptom-based insights accessible to users in a simple, intuitive format.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Joblib
